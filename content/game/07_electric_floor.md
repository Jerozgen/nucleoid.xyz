Electric Floor is a free-for-all "the-floor-is-lava!" party game in which players must run from a floor that electrifies beneath them! The floor transitions from white to blue to purple to red each time a player walks over it. Once a block is red, it will eliminate any player who steps upon it. 

The last surviving player wins!
