# nucleoid.xyz
This is the repository holding the [nucleoid.xyz](https://nucleoid.xyz/) website!

This website is built on the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) engine for generating static content.

## Building
To build the site locally, you will first need to [install Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/).

You should then be able to access the site by running `zola serve` and pointing your browser to http://127.0.0.1:1111.

You can also run `zola build`, which will output the static site into the `public/` directory.
